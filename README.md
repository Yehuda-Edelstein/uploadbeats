# uploadbeats

I made this script so that I could quickly upload hip hop beats to youtube and beatstars. In the process I added some cool features that may be useful to other producers who are looking to automate some of the beatmaking process. 

A lot of the variables, file paths, etc., need to be changed or adjusted to work on your local device; a lot of data was set assuming you were running the script on my mac lol.
